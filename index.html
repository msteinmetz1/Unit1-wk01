        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>Hello everyone! My name is Makayla Steinmetz, but occasionally go by Kayla.
            I am currently a Senior at Lewis-Clark State <br>college pursuing an Associates Degree in Web Design and Development.</p>
		<p>Before starting at LCSC I attended college at the College of Western Idaho for Software Development and<br>
            the College of Southern Idaho for Elementary Education. I've had a variety of experiences in education so<br> far because of the differences in these degrees.</p>
    	<p>My goal is to obtain a career that will help with the furthering my education and
             give my kids the<br> options for education that I didn't have.</p>
